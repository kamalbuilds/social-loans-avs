# Brevis Powered Social Loans AVS
## Environment Requirements

- Go >= 1.20
- Node.js LTS

## [Prover](./prover)

The prover service is a standalone process that is run on a server, preferably as a systemd managed process so that it can be auto restarted if any crash happens. The prover service is designed to be used in conjunction with [brevis-network/brevis-sdk-typescript](https://github.com/brevis-network/brevis-sdk-typescript). 

### Start Prover (for testing)

```bash
cd prover
make start
```

### Start Prover with Systemd (in production on linux server)

You may want to have a process daemon to manage the prover services in production. The [Makefile](prover/Makefileefile) in the project root contains some convenience scripts. 

To build, init systemd, and start both prover processes, run the following command. Note it requires sudo privilege because we want to use systemd commands

```bash
cd prover
make deploy
```

# [App](./app)

The Node.js project in ./app is a simple program that does the following things:

1. call the Go prover with some transaction data to generate an account age proof
2. call Brevis backend service and submit the account age proof
3. wait until the final proof is submitted on-chain and our contract is called

## How to Run

```bash
cd app
npm run start [TransactionHash]
```
Example for Normal Flow
```bash
npm run start 0x02869126ca667c76e819078d5326feb5d17f276ce5786de47e78334f15530e74
```

Example for Brevis Partner Flow
```bash
npm run start 0x02869126ca667c76e819078d5326feb5d17f276ce5786de47e78334f15530e74 TEST_ACCOUNT_AGE_KEY 0xeec66d9b615ff84909be1cb1fe633cc26150417d
```
>[!NOTE]
>Brevis partner key **IS NOT** required to submit request to Brevis Gateway

# [Contracts](./contracts)

The app contract [AccountAge.sol](./contracts/contracts/AccountAge.sol) is called
after you submit proof is submitted to Brevis when Brevis'
systems submit the final proof on-chain.
It does the following things when handling the callback:

1. checks the proof was associated with the correct vk hash
2. decodes the circuit output
3. emit a simple event

## Init

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
```

## Test

```bash
npm run test
```

## Deploy

Rename `.env.template` to `.env`. Fill in the required env vars.

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia --tags AccountAge
```
